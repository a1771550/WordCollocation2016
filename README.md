Features:     

1. Make collocation between words. Eg: what are any adjectives available for the word "abandon"? Ans: passionate       
  
2. ASP.Net wants data from MySQL, it asks a PHP page for it and the PHP page returns JSON which is then used by the ASP.Net as if it was talking to the DB itself.
